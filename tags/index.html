What happens is that each instance first looks for which class it belongs to then it goes and looks for the method reference that was called upon and then we can think that the instance is sent as the first argument to that method but in reality it is bound to that method so nobody needs to send it as an argument.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/tags/tutorial class="link blue hover-black">Tag: tutorial</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/hosting_hugo_on_github/ class="link black dim">Hosting Hugo on GitHub</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Hosting your static site on Git Hub.
