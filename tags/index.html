Division by zero is a short story by Ted Chiang.
It&rsquo;s a story about a mathematician proving arithmatic is incosistent. That two is equal to one without using division by zero.
The proof is not important but it&rsquo;s implication is not on the world but on the mathematician who proved it. I never imagined that if somebody wrote a story about arithmatic being incosistent it would focus on the mental health of the individual who proved it.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/towers_of_babylon/ class="link black dim">Towers of Babylon</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A beautiful story with and unexpected ending.

Normal Methods All methods are defined and their reference is stored only once inside a class.
So how do all instances of class have access to that method?
What happens is that each instance first looks for which class it belongs to then it goes and looks for the method reference that was called upon and then we can think that the instance is sent as the first argument to that method but in reality it is bound to that method so nobody needs to send it as an argument.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/tags/tutorial class="link blue hover-black">Tag: tutorial</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/hosting_hugo_on_github/ class="link black dim">Hosting Hugo on GitHub</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Hosting your static site on Git Hub.
