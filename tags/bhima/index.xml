Beginning Bhima opens with the Pandavas in the middle of their journey to Mount Meru. When Draupadi has just fallen but none of the Pandava brother seem to care. Not the son of Dharma, Yudhishthira nor the Arjuna whom draupadi loves the most. Even Nakula and Sehdeva seem to not care for the women who&amp;rsquo;ve been like a mother to them for most of their life.</description></item></channel></rss>
