It was friday 26th August 2022 when I went to see the final match of maharaja trophy played between banglore and gulbarga.
I went to the final with few of my friends and it was a lot of fun and the match was worth the money which was not much one ticket costed us around Rs. 110 but the match we saw had us on the edge of our seats the entire team both teams scored more than 200 runs and it was a sight to see.</description></item></channel></rss>
