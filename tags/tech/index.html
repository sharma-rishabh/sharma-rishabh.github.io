Event An event is defined as a &ldquo;significant change in state&rdquo;.
for sale -> sold interviewed -> hired low battery -> charging We can build a system that performs certain operation on basis of these state changes. Any and all state changes can be considered an event.
An event shouldn&rsquo;t be confused with the message/data that we send with it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/create_your_react_component/ class="link black dim">Create your react component</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Creating your own react component is supereasy.

Creating an React Element React.createElement('Element name', props, ...children) Mounting a React Elment After creating an element you will need a place to mount the element until then the element you created will not be present in HTML DOM.

Generic also helps you to write code that can work with wide variety of types. So you don&rsquo;t need to overload a function uneccesarily.
Syntax for classes class Box&lt;T> { } class Pencil { } // Class creation Box&lt;Pencil> = new Box&lt;Pencil>(); In the example above we are creating a generic class and we are telling a type T will be given at call time in the example above we created a class Box and at call time we provided a class Pencil.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/inheritance_in_java/ class="link black dim">Inheritance in java</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In english inherit means to derive qualities from your ancestors genetically.
Just like this in java also, one class can inherit properties and methods of another class using inheritance.
Child extends Parent { } This is the basic syntax for inheritance, We use extends keyword to inherit a class. The class that inherits is also called the subclass and the class which was inherited is called superclass.
To refer to parent class from child class we use super keyword and we need to construct parent in the child class before we intialize any of our properties in our constructor.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/strings_and_arrays/ class="link black dim">Strings and Arrays</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Strings Strings are immutable and they don&rsquo;t change once defined. String is a class in java which allows you to initialize a string literal. String can be initialize in two different ways
Declaring strings like a normal data type
String name = "some name"; Initialializing a new class method.
String name = new String("some name"); String comes with various different methods like charAt, contains, replace, replaceAll, trim, split. We cannot use indecies to access chars in a string because they are not iterable.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/packages_in_java/ class="link black dim">Packages in Java</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Package A package is a grouping of related types providing access protection and name space management.
Advantages Easy to determine how types are related. Makes sure that your names don&rsquo;t conflict with the names used in the package. Creating a package import mypackage; Naming Convention Packages solve the naming problem but what if two programmers create packages with the same name. That&rsquo;s why we have naming convention for packages.
Package names are written in all lowercase.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/method_overloading_in_java/ class="link black dim">Method overloading in java</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Method overloading is the process of having mulitple method defination with a single name. The complier knows which one to call on the basis of the signature of the method which ever signature matches the call that method is invoked.
By default while overloading if the contract doesn&rsquo;t match it tries to type convert and see if any siganture match like you can have a method to add two ints and if you try to call it with chars it will get invoked.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/data_types_in_java/ class="link black dim">Data types in java</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Java is a very strict language when it comes to types. If you want to do anything remotely complex you need to know what types are available.
For simply declaring a function you need to know what type you&rsquo;ll return and what types you&rsquo;ll accept beforehand which makes your life simple and complex at the same time.
It makes your life simple when you&rsquo;re writing the method but When you&rsquo;re trying to come up with it&rsquo;s signature you need to spend time to ensure you&rsquo;re defining it correctly.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/java/ class="link black dim">Starting With Java</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Java is a type specific language which is a lot stricter than javascript.
Let&rsquo;s follow the journey of java code.
First Java code is compiled into byte code by a compiler. Byte code is highly optimised so the code can be run quickly by JVM Java Virtual Machine. JVM combined with some System Library make a JRE Java Run Time Environment. The compiler and the JRE together make JDK Java Development Kit.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/hosting_hugo_on_github/ class="link black dim">Hosting Hugo on GitHub</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Hosting your static site on Git Hub.

Normal Methods All methods are defined and their reference is stored only once inside a class.
So how do all instances of class have access to that method?
What happens is that each instance first looks for which class it belongs to then it goes and looks for the method reference that was called upon and then we can think that the instance is sent as the first argument to that method but in reality it is bound to that method so nobody needs to send it as an argument.</div></div></div></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/>&copy; Rishabh's Blog 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
