If you want to do anything remotely complex you need to know what types are available.
For simply declaring a function you need to know what type you&amp;rsquo;ll return and what types you&amp;rsquo;ll accept beforehand which makes your life simple and complex at the same time.
It makes your life simple when you&amp;rsquo;re writing the method but When you&amp;rsquo;re trying to come up with it&amp;rsquo;s signature you need to spend time to ensure you&amp;rsquo;re defining it correctly.</description></item><item><title>Starting With Java</title><link>https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/posts/java/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 18:26:43 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/posts/java/</guid><description>Java is a type specific language which is a lot stricter than javascript.
Let&amp;rsquo;s follow the journey of java code.
First Java code is compiled into byte code by a compiler. Byte code is highly optimised so the code can be run quickly by JVM Java Virtual Machine. JVM combined with some System Library make a JRE Java Run Time Environment. The compiler and the JRE together make JDK Java Development Kit.</description></item><item><title>Hosting Hugo on GitHub</title><link>https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/posts/hosting_hugo_on_github/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 14:10:29 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/posts/hosting_hugo_on_github/</guid><description>Hosting your static site on Git Hub.

Normal Methods All methods are defined and their reference is stored only once inside a class.
So how do all instances of class have access to that method?
What happens is that each instance first looks for which class it belongs to then it goes and looks for the method reference that was called upon and then we can think that the instance is sent as the first argument to that method but in reality it is bound to that method so nobody needs to send it as an argument.</description></item></channel></rss>
