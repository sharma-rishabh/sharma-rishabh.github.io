# Exciting match at chinnaswamy stadium.

It was friday 26th August 2022 when I went to see the final match of maharaja trophy played between banglore and gulbarga.

I went to the final with few of my friends and it was a lot of fun and the match was worth the money which was not much one ticket costed us around Rs. 110 but the match we saw had us on the edge of our seats the entire team both teams scored more than 200 runs and it was a sight to see.

Even though the team I was supporting lost I had a lot of fun.


## Backstory

Sunday 21 August 2022 Me and my friends wanted to see chinnaswamy stadium but they only allow people in on match days. So my friends told me that there was a t20 match of some maharaja trophy on sunday so we can go and see the stadium. I said why not and we bought a few tickets and went in.
We had no high expectations our main focus was to see the stadium but the match had us glued to our seats the whole time. We had soo much fun even though the match was cut short due to rain. We went to our pg with satisfaction and we decided to go watch another match on next sunday but we quickly found that the final was on friday and there will be no match on sunday.


## On the day of the final 

We are in our office it looks like the rain won't stop it's been raining since 12 O'clock last night it only stopped in the morning for few hours.

It's 2 O'clock it is still raining heavily. We don't have much hope that we would be able to the final in this rain.

It's 5 O'clock the rain has stopped the final might just happen but we are not sure if we should go. We might not get any transport due to heavy rain. 

It's 8 O'clock match has started 5 overs have been bowled. We are still in office.

It's 8:15 We decide that we will go!! We start booking cabs but no one is accepting any rides due to heavy rain as we expedted 15 mins pass we try autos, cabs, ola, uber nobody wants to take us.

One guy suddenly accepts the ride we go as fast as we can. We encouter some traffic on our way as we expected but we finally reach the stadium first inning is almost over with only one over left.

## The seccond innings

After all this we will finally see some good batting. I was wrong.

The team I'm supporting just got down to bat but it feels like only a few seconds have passed but already 4 overs are done and 4 wickets have fallen. I've lost hope that my team will win. but then something amazing happened the two batters on the pitch starting belting the bowling line up and by the end of the fourteenth over it feels like my team might just get through to the humongous ask of 221 runs but then almost at the end of 16th over chetan gets bowled oh he was so close to his hundered only 15 runs away. It's fine kirti is still at the crease he can take my team across.
But by the end of 17th over he also falls there's no hope once again but I've enjoyed my time watching my team play and cheering them on the entire time.
