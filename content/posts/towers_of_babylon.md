# A beautiful story with and unexpected ending.

Towers of babylon is a short story by Ted Chiang.

It introduced me to towers of babylon. The story follows Hellalium who's a miner 
from elam. Who's questions about the tower reflect some of mine. Including why is
there even a tower, is it morally right for humans to open the vaults of heaven.
What about the humans who live on the tower. Who have never what land looks like
whose plants grow downward rather than upward for them sun never reaches a place
higher than themselves. What would they feel if they traveled back to land from 
the sky. The question about these humans became even more relevant when I finished
the story.They have spent thier generations to build this tower so that one day they can be
nearer to Yahweh what would there reaction be once they get to know the truth.
 
The tower was described by Chiang beautifully he really ensures that the reader 
feels the enormity of it. And the environment was described through feelings of 
Hellalium as he ascending the tower.

This was my review for Towers of Babylon.
