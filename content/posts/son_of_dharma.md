The sun is blazing, you can hear the birds in the nearby forest. Young Yundhishtira is out in his chariot alone. A single horse is pulling this chariot, Yudhishtira is going through the forest without much attention, his thoughts are occupied by the strategies he can use to win a game of dice. He's planning to ask his uncle vidura to join him for another game tonight. He's smiling thinking about winning tonight's game. Even though it isn't even confirmed yet. 

Yudhishtira wakes up form his daydream after hearing the sound of another chariot. He looks back to see who it is, all that is visible is the image of god Surya. The other cahriot is catching up with Yudhishtira. He thinks that it might be some enemy nation trying to kidnap the future king of Hastinapur. So Yudhistira tries to escape but the other charioteer seems to be skilled and he's chatching up to him quickly. As the other charioteer comes close Yudhishtira realises him to be Karna the son of Soota. Yudhishtira slows down and let's karna catch up to him.

"I see your father has taught you well, you'll soon be able to serve me if you keep up with your practice."

"You know I'm a better warrior than all you brothers put together."

"It hardly matters son of Soota you'll never be allowed to fight with us. A kshatriya only fights with his equals or higher caste."

"That is your good luck."

Karna speeds up his chariot, leaving the future king behind. Yudhishtira speeds up too, he overtakes karna but he's not in full control of his chariot. Just after a few feet his chariot goes off road and his wheel is stuck in ground. Karna catches up with him and shoots an arrow towards Yudhishtir which takes off his head ornament and the arrow hits the back wall of his chariot. Yudhishtira with a flushed face yells at karna.

"You son of Soota. Don't you know it is against dharma to attack an opponent while his chariot is stuck."

"That's why I didn't attack you, son of kunti. If I wanted I could've detached your head from your body just like I detatched your ornament from your head."

Karna takes off in his chariot. Yudhishtira stands bewildere at the audacity of Karna.
