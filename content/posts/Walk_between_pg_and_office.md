This is the story of what goes on in my mind while I'm walking from pg to home or home to pg. 

First thing I wanna mention is Ashirwad it's a house near our office which has a circular tower rising on top of it's roof which makes it look like a fort it has a big garden I don't like it much but that circular tower grabs my attentioin every morning I pass by it.

Second thing that grabs my attention is the hole in the wall cafe which looks like an old cafe it's not impressive by any means but if you pass by it on a sunday or a saturday you'll find a lot people waiting in queue to get in. It shocked me the first time I saw it I thought to myself why would you want to eat here of all places. Another odd thing that I've noticed about that place is that there is always one person there with a suitcase on weekends. 

Third thing I notice is an audi that is parked from monday to friday in front of an office building near our pg in the morning I don't know what it is about that car but it just looks so beautiful. One of the reasons for it's good looks is that it's white and it's always white I've never seen it dirty. Another one of the reason would be it's black alloys which cotrast the white but copmliment it beautifully.

Fourth thing is the a cake shop where all our batchmates celebrate their birthday. Another reason I notice that shop is that it is next to a shop which has a huge display where they display one of their dresses.
