Division by zero is a short story by Ted Chiang.
It&rsquo;s a story about a mathematician proving arithmatic is incosistent. That two is equal to one without using division by zero.
The proof is not important but it&rsquo;s implication is not on the world but on the mathematician who proved it. I never imagined that if somebody wrote a story about arithmatic being incosistent it would focus on the mental health of the individual who proved it."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.103.1"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Division by zero"><meta property="og:description" content="A human story about science.

I never imagined that if somebody wrote a story about arithmatic being incosistent it would focus on the mental health of the individual who proved it.</p><p>The story follows the story of a couple who&rsquo;ve both tried to commit suicide once in their life both for differnt reasons.</p><p>The story starts with Reene still in suicide care and Carl her husband regularly visting cause he knows what&rsquo;s it like to be in the situation Reene is.</p><p>Reene is a mathmatician who has proved one is equal to two without using division by zero. This proof has impacted her personal life more than the professional. She doesn&rsquo;t wanna believe that her proof is correct. The proof means that everything she ever believed in was a lie.</p><p>Meanwhile Carl Reene&rsquo;s husband is also affected by this proof as her wife is no longer how she used to be. Even though Carl has a lot of empathy for suicidal people as he was one of them at one point. He still can only feel empathy for Reene cause he can&rsquo;t understand what she&rsquo;s going through.
The sad part is that he only feels sympathy towards her not even love and he plans to leave her when she gets well.</p><p>The story over all was heart touching and a very human story, the story resonated with me throughout.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/review class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">review</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/literature class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">literature</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/towers_of_babylon/>Towers of Babylon</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/>&copy; Rishabh's Blog 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
