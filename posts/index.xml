Normal Methods All methods are defined and their reference is stored only once inside a class.
So how do all instances of class have access to that method?
What happens is that each instance first looks for which class it belongs to then it goes and looks for the method reference that was called upon and then we can think that the instance is sent as the first argument to that method but in reality it is bound to that method so nobody needs to send it as an argument.</description></item><item><title>Towers of Babylon</title><link>https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/posts/towers_of_babylon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 20:38:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/posts/towers_of_babylon/</guid><description>A beautiful story with and unexpected ending.
