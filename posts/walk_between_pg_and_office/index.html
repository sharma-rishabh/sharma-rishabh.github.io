It shocked me the first time I saw it I thought to myself why would you want to eat here of all places. Another odd thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed about that place is that there is always one person there with a suitcase on weekends.</p><p>Third thing I notice is an audi that is parked from monday to friday in front of an office building near our pg in the morning I don&rsquo;t know what it is about that car but it just looks so beautiful. One of the reasons for it&rsquo;s good looks is that it&rsquo;s white and it&rsquo;s always white I&rsquo;ve never seen it dirty. Another one of the reason would be it&rsquo;s black alloys which cotrast the white but copmliment it beautifully.</p><p>Fourth thing is the a cake shop where all our batchmates celebrate their birthday. Another reason I notice that shop is that it is next to a shop which has a huge display where they display one of their dresses.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/literature class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">literature</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/division_by_zero/>Division by zero</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/towers_of_babylon/>Towers of Babylon</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/>&copy; Rishabh's Blog 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
