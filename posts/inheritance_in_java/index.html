Just like this in java also, one class can inherit properties and methods of another class using inheritance.
Child extends Parent { } This is the basic syntax for inheritance, We use extends keyword to inherit a class. The class that inherits is also called the subclass and the class which was inherited is called superclass.
To refer to parent class from child class we use super keyword and we need to construct parent in the child class before we intialize any of our properties in our constructor."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.104.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Inheritance in java"><meta property="og:description" content="In english inherit means to derive qualities from your ancestors genetically.

It&rsquo;s not neccessary in all cases but it is good practice to use it to increase the readability of our code.</p><p>In java a class can only inherit one class. but multi level inheritance is still allowed.</p><p>Some classes may have similar methods doesn&rsquo;t mean inheritance is a great idea there a bird and a plane both can fly but one shouldn&rsquo;t inherit the other. To determine whether a class can inherit others you can use <code>is a</code>, if both classes have a <code>is a</code> realtionship.</p><p>Ex:- A lion is a cat.</p><p>So lion class can inherit cat class.</p><p>In general avoiding inheritance unless necessary is great practice. With inheritance you might want the banana but you will get the whole jungle.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/tech class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">tech</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/java class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">java</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/strings_and_arrays/>Strings and Arrays</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/packages_in_java/>Packages in Java</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/method_overloading_in_java/>Method overloading in java</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/data_types_in_java/>Data types in java</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/java/>Starting With Java</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/hosting_hugo_on_github/>Hosting Hugo on GitHub</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/hugo/>Hugo</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/static_methods/>Static Methods</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/>&copy; Rishabh's Blog 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
