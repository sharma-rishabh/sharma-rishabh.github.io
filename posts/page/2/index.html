Advantages Easy to determine how types are related. Makes sure that your names don&rsquo;t conflict with the names used in the package. Creating a package import mypackage; Naming Convention Packages solve the naming problem but what if two programmers create packages with the same name. That&rsquo;s why we have naming convention for packages.
Package names are written in all lowercase.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/method_overloading_in_java/ class="link black dim">Method overloading in java</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Method overloading is the process of having mulitple method defination with a single name. The complier knows which one to call on the basis of the signature of the method which ever signature matches the call that method is invoked.
By default while overloading if the contract doesn&rsquo;t match it tries to type convert and see if any siganture match like you can have a method to add two ints and if you try to call it with chars it will get invoked.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/data_types_in_java/ class="link black dim">Data types in java</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Java is a very strict language when it comes to types. If you want to do anything remotely complex you need to know what types are available.
For simply declaring a function you need to know what type you&rsquo;ll return and what types you&rsquo;ll accept beforehand which makes your life simple and complex at the same time.
It makes your life simple when you&rsquo;re writing the method but When you&rsquo;re trying to come up with it&rsquo;s signature you need to spend time to ensure you&rsquo;re defining it correctly.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/java/ class="link black dim">Starting With Java</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Java is a type specific language which is a lot stricter than javascript.
Let&rsquo;s follow the journey of java code.
First Java code is compiled into byte code by a compiler. Byte code is highly optimised so the code can be run quickly by JVM Java Virtual Machine. JVM combined with some System Library make a JRE Java Run Time Environment. The compiler and the JRE together make JDK Java Development Kit.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/walk_between_pg_and_office/ class="link black dim">Walk Between PG and Office</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the story of what goes on in my mind while I&rsquo;m walking from pg to office or office to pg.

Division by zero is a short story by Ted Chiang.
It&rsquo;s a story about a mathematician proving arithmatic is incosistent. That two is equal to one without using division by zero.
The proof is not important but it&rsquo;s implication is not on the world but on the mathematician who proved it. I never imagined that if somebody wrote a story about arithmatic being incosistent it would focus on the mental health of the individual who proved it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/maharaja_trophy_final/ class="link black dim">Maharaja trophy final</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Exciting match at chinnaswamy stadium.

Normal Methods All methods are defined and their reference is stored only once inside a class.
So how do all instances of class have access to that method?
What happens is that each instance first looks for which class it belongs to then it goes and looks for the method reference that was called upon and then we can think that the instance is sent as the first argument to that method but in reality it is bound to that method so nobody needs to send it as an argument.</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/3/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/3/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/>&copy; Rishabh's Blog 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
