Usually if they changed during an operation they will get promoted to a data type which occupies more memory or to a data type which is higher on the hierarchy like floats sits higher on the hierarchy than int and longs even though a long occupies more memory and can hold larger values.</p><p>Chars will be converted to int when any arithmatic operation on them is stored in and int it will yeild an int.
Char will be converted to its relative ascii value and then the arithmatic operation is performend on it.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re trying to do something like</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-java data-lang=java><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>float</span> a<span style=color:#f92672>=</span>1<span style=color:#f92672>.</span><span style=color:#a6e22e>2</span><span style=color:#f92672>;</span>

If you think about the contract not just in terms of values but also types than it will make your code much cleaner and your contracts much stronger.</p><p>This is the main advantage for Java as it forces you to think about the contracts not just in terms of values but also in terms of types.</p><p>The compiler itself will make sure you&rsquo;re never violating a functions contract.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/tech class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">tech</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/java/>Starting With Java</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/hosting_hugo_on_github/>Hosting Hugo on GitHub</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/hugo/>Hugo</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/static_methods/>Static Methods</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/>&copy; Rishabh's Blog 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
