The story follows Hellalium who&rsquo;s a miner
from elam. Who&rsquo;s questions about the tower reflect some of mine. Including why is
there even a tower, is it morally right for humans to open the vaults of heaven.
What about the humans who live on the tower. Who have never what land looks like
whose plants grow downward rather than upward for them sun never reaches a place
higher than themselves. What would they feel if they traveled back to land from
the sky. The question about these humans became even more relevant when I finished
the story.They have spent thier generations to build this tower so that one day they can be
nearer to Yahweh what would there reaction be once they get to know the truth.</p><p>The tower was described by Chiang beautifully he really ensures that the reader
feels the enormity of it. And the environment was described through feelings of
Hellalium as he ascending the tower.</p><p>This was my review for Towers of Babylon.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/review class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">review</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/literature class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">literature</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://sharma-rishabh.github.io/>&copy; Rishabh's Blog 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
